# Networks Sciences (MO412 / MC908) - Assignment 9

## Copying Model

Use the rate equation approach to show that the directed copying model ([Section 5.9 of the book](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/5#origins "Network Science, by Albert-László Barabási")) leads to a scale-free network with incoming degree exponent `γ_in = (2−p)/(1−p)`, where `p` is the probability involved in the model.
